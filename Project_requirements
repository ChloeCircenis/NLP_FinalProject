# Project Deliverables

## Project Groups (0%) - Due March 14th - **DONE**

## Abstract (5%) - Due March 21st  
Submit a PDF containing an outline of your idea, stating what the problem is and how you will formulate the task. The submission should contain 1-2 paragraphs (about 300 words) summarizing what your project is about and listing the names of all team members.  

You will receive substantial actionable feedback from the instructors on your abstract to help you flesh out your ideas and complete the project within the timeline. Feedback will be communicated by **March 24th**.

## Progress Report (5%) - Due April 11th  
The progress report should be a more substantial description of the work completed since starting the project. This report will provide a comprehensive update on:  
- Completed tasks  
- Remaining tasks  
- Any difficulties encountered  

By this time, preliminary work should at least include making decisions on datasets, models, and reviewing related work to improve your solution.  

### **Dataset Details**  
- Describe details about the dataset you’ve chosen – how many examples are there, what statistics do you observe about the examples (length, number of classes, etc.), how did you create training/validation/test sets?

### **Model Details**  
- You should also include details about the models you’ve chosen – what type of model is it, how large is it, what tasks does it perform well at, how will you train it (e.g., using SGD vs using clustering/some other ML algorithm), what libraries will you use for your implementation, what computational resources will you require and what your plan is for accessing them. Include any preliminary results that you have already gotten, especially by running baselines.

Include any preliminary results, particularly baseline performance.  

### **Related Work**  
-  You should also describe related work to the problem you’ve picked – for example, if you are comparing Transformers and LSTMs for the task of Grapheme to Phoneme (G2P) conversion in Turkish, look at how research has typically solved the G2P problem in other languages like English, as well as research from linguistics that outlines what makes this a difficult problem in Turkish.  

Check out the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/) for research papers organized by conference and year.  
Include references to the papers in your report. Be sure to reference at least 4 papers in the related work, we typically expect a good related work to mention ~5-10 papers.

### **Team Responsibilities**  
Provide a breakdown of team members' roles and responsibilities.  

The progress report should be a **3-page PDF** with the following sections:  
- **Introduction**  
- **Data**  
- **Methods**  
- **Related Work**  
- **Next Steps**  
- (Optional) Issues requiring assistance  

## Presentation (20%) - April 23rd, April 25th, or May 6th  
The final project presentation should be **10 minutes long** (subject to change depending on the number of groups).  

### **Presentation Requirements**  
- **Slide deck** (10-25 slides) explaining:  
  - Project goals and problem statement  
  - All steps of the solution  
  - Performance comparison with baselines  
  - Error analysis and potential limitations  

- **Figures for visualization** (e.g., bar charts for model performance, scatter plots/confusion matrices for error analysis)  

**Grading Criteria:**  
- Quality of the solution  
- Clarity and detail in the presentation  

## Implementation (10%) - Due May 6th  
Submit the **codebase** containing your NLP system. The submission should include:  
- All code files, including scripts for **data pre/post-processing**  
- A **detailed README** explaining how to reproduce results  

### **README Requirements**  
- Steps to obtain datasets  
- Environment setup details (library versions, dependencies)  
- Hyperparameters used  
- Dataset preprocessing and formatting instructions  
- Expected input/output formats (e.g., where predictions are saved, model checkpoint locations)  

Your implementation should be fully reproducible, allowing others to **train models and obtain the same results** following your instructions.
