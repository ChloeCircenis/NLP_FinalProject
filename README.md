# TODO 
- Write a detailed README document describing how to reproduce your results – you will be evaluated on this component and we should be able to reproduce your exact results by training models following your instructions. This includes details like how to obtain the datasets that you used, how to set up the coding environments that you used, what versions of libraries you used, what hyperparameters to use, and any other important details that a new user needs to know in order to run your code. You must also describe how the dataset must be preprocessed and formatted for your code, and clearly state what the input and expected output are (e.g., does the code write out predictions to some file, where are model checkpoints saved, etc.). 
- Make sure the README document also contains a summary of your final results – e.g., expected test set performance on dataset A=82 F1, dataset B=65 F1. Please include an indication of which team member is responsible for which part of the codebase. Please check Important Notes for more details on what we require from your code.
- Submit a single zip file that includes all the code files and README. Do not include your model checkpoints or dataset. You may upload the supporting files like dataset, model checkpoints and any result files to your personal google drive and link them in your README.
